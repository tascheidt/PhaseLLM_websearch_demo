It\u2019s highly popular with travelers due to its relaxed atmosphere, beautiful landscapes and excellent hostels. However, many visitors don\u2019t have weeks to enjoy chilling out in the village, so here\u2019s a quick guide on how to make the most of 48 hours in Minca.          View All Trips                    Arriving at lunchtime from Santa Marta, the first thing to do is grab a bite to eat in town, and there\u2019s nowhere better to do that than at The Lazy Cat, a great little restaurant just opposite the village church, which overlooks the river and serves the best burgers and burritos in town. Then wander across the bridge towards Cafe Minca for a local coffee. Even if you\u2019re not staying there, the adjacent Hotel Minca is worth a visit to enjoy their amazing hummingbird feeders, which attract an array of the colorful little birds.

The best place in town to stay is the delightful Casa Loma Hostel, which is perched on a hillside above the village and commands amazing views over the distant Caribbean Sea and the gorgeous green mountains. Check in here, order a delicious vegan dinner for the evening, then spend the rest of your first day relaxing, enjoying the view and waiting for the sunset. Casa Loma has the best sunset views in town, and there\u2019s even a great happy hour to make the evening pass even quicker. Get an early night, because there\u2019s a lot to do tomorrow.     Wake up nice and early (it\u2019s much cooler and fresher in the morning), and head down into Minca to grab a mototaxi up into the mountains to La Victoria Coffee Farm. This working coffee farm is one of the oldest in Colombia and offers a fascinating glimpse at the old machinery once used to harvest the magic little beans, which is still in use today! Take the tour at La Victoria in the morning, then stick around for lunch to enjoy one of their delicious sandwiches and an ice cold Happy Toucan Beer, which is also brewed on site. After lunch, walk back towards Minca from the farm along the road towards Pozos Naturales (grab another mototaxi if you\u2019re not the hiking type).       Coffee drying at La Victoria in Minca | \u00a9 Chris Bell / The Culture Trip                Pozos Naturales is a lovely little swimming hole on the river between La Victoria and Minca, and is the perfect place to enjoy a refreshing dip in the cooling waters of the Sierra Nevada (don\u2019t forget to pack your bathing suit when you leave in the morning). There are many stalls along the road from the Pozos to Minca, where you can sample local chocolate and honey products, and enjoy the mountain views. Always keep an eye out for Toucans as well: they are commonly seen along this road. Grab some dinner in Minca \u2013 you\u2019re forgiven if you choose The Lazy Cat again \u2013 and head back up to Casa Loma: there\u2019s still the happy hour to look forward to!     On your final morning, rise nice and early and meet up with Jungle Joe down in the village \u2013 he offers excellent beginner\u2019s birding tours on the trails around the village and is the perfect man with whom to discover the feathered joys of the Santa Marta Mountains. You can see toucans, parrots, owls, woodpeckers and much more with Joe, and he\u2019s a patient and understandable guide. You\u2019ll be finished by 9:30 am, which gives you a couple more hours to enjoy: hop on a quick mototaxi and head to Marinka Waterfalls to enjoy a last cooling dip in the river, before you head back down the mountains to the sweltering heat of the coast.

It smells of caramel, bark, charcoal, and chocolate. The source? Coffee beans, fresh from backyard roasters, their sharp burnt odor cutting through the humid tropical haze.Here in northern Colombia, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta range rises straight from the shores of the Caribbean. Long left undeveloped due to political troubles, this now peaceful area draws urban Colombians and savvy international visitors to the palm-fringed beaches of Tayrona National Park, the ancient archaeological site of Ciudad Perdida, and the birding paradise of the jungles around Minca.Recently, Minca and the Sierra Nevada have begun to attract coffee-loving travelers, a collection of connoisseurs and curious backpackers eager to discover what Juan Pablo Campos, general manager of the Lohas Beans trade group, calls \u201cthe most important Colombian region for organic coffee.\u201dUsing a pestle, Minca coffee grower Angel Maria Orozco peels the hard outer skin of dried coffee beans.Photograph by Francesco LastrucciPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.While coffee is not native to Colombia, the plant has flourished for centuries on the country\u2019s steep, shade-covered mountains, with rainfall, altitude, and temperatures ideal for growing the mellow, medium-bodied arabica-style bean. Colombia has been exporting coffee since the early 1800s, and in 2015 alone shipped 840,000 tons of coffee beans. Represented by the fictional ambassadors Juan Valdez and his trusty burro, Conchita, \u201cCaf\u00e9 de Colombia\u201d has become known worldwide.A map of northern Colombia, where the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta range rises straight from the shores of the Caribbean\nNG Maps, World Database on Protected AreasPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.Colombia\u2019s better-known \u201ccoffee triangle\u201d in the country\u2019s southwest now supports a well-trod tourist track between luxury lodges and standardized plantation tours, but the Sierra Nevada still offers an authentic journey into the past\u2014and a taste of the future of Colombian coffee. In remote highlands, indigenous tribes of Kogi and Arhuaco lead the way in organic coffee production, developing a sustainable farming network that combines traditional spiritual beliefs with modern planting knowledge. These farms embrace generations-old techniques and tools to produce sought-after organic blends, with many beans \u201ctriple certified\u201d as organic, fair trade, and rain forest-friendly.A local harvest of organically grown coffee fruit eventually ends up as a drink to linger over at Ikaro Caf\u00e9, in Santa Marta.Photograph by Francesco LastrucciPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.The gateway to the region is the sunny Caribbean seaside city of Santa Marta, where the bitter street blend of tinto (from the Spanish word for ink) black coffee is sweetened with spoonfuls of sugar. Coffee aficionados will skip the tinto, as well as the ubiquitous Juan Valdez chain stores, and head to Santa Marta\u2019s smaller shops, such as Ikaro Caf\u00e9.Exploring the area\u2019s coffee culture is best done during harvest season, from about November through February, and can be as simple as hiring a taxi for the approximately 40-minute, 15-mile bumpy ride from the sea to the hills. Visits to tribal lands require special permission or an organized trip from an approved local operator such as Wiwa Tour.A stop at Hacienda la Victoria above Minca is like traveling to 1892, when the farm was founded. Husband-and-wife owners Micky and Claudia Weber provide a bean-to-brew education on growing, processing, and roasting coffee. Visitors will see the same well-oiled machinery in use since the farm\u2019s beginnings: water-powered generators, gravity-driven sorters, and hand-cranked presses. Tours conclude with a tasting of their blends, often accompanied by homemade apple pie. Other local farms promote scheduled and drop-in tours and tastings of high-end coffees\u2014a difference from only a few years ago when Colombia had an unofficial policy of \u201cexport the best, and drink the rest.\u201dAt Hacienda la Victoria, owner Claudia Weber inhales the robust aroma of freshly washed and dried coffee beans.Photograph by Francesco LastrucciPlease be respectful of copyright.

Hiking trails wind through Sierra Nevada rain forest to the Marinka and Pozo Azul waterfalls. Hundreds of butterfly and bird species native to the area include \u201cparrots so plentiful they\u2019re like pigeons,\u201d according to one visitor.A local harvest of organically grown coffee fruit in northern Colombia\nPhotograph by Francesco LastrucciPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.Minca plantations may flash back a few generations, but indigenous Kogi farms (or those of the more remote Arhuaco), located deeper in the mountains, are a journey back centuries. The tribes live without electricity in traditional adobe huts with thatched roofs. They often carry their mochila (handwoven knapsack) and wear homespun cotton clothing, white to symbolize the purity of nature. Their traditional conical headgear represents sacred snowcapped mountain peaks. Their mamos (spiritual guides) perform purification ceremonies of prayer and song prior to planting and harvesting the beans.It all works in harmony with the land, their neighbors, and modern markets, nurturing a future model not only for growing coffee but for ripening Colombian tourism itself.Where to Get a Cup of JoeIkaro Caf\u00e9 Local organic coffee, vegan and vegetarian fare, and a bright interior make this one of the best hangouts in Santa Marta.Tienda Caf\u00e9 Fans of this classic Minca spot savor their cups of local roasts (and a brownie) outside on the porch, but head inside for a trove of handicrafts for sale.Hacienda la Victoria Enjoy un caf\u00e9 \u2028at its source at \u2028this 124-year-old family-owned coffee plantation, which also offers tours and an on-site bistro.Nat Geo ExpeditionsBook your next trip with Peace of MindSearch TripsWhere to StayEcohabs Tayrona Thatched seaside bungalows designed by a local architect nestle in Tayrona National Park.La Brisa Loca At this social Santa Marta hostel, friendships form at the courtyard pool and the rooftop bar.Casa Loma Minca The view from the top is worth the climb up the long flight of stairs to this Minca hostel on a hill.Travel to Colombia with Nat Geo A 12-day itinerary includes the country\u2019s southeastern coffee triangle and Tayrona National Park.BILL FINK (@finktravels) can often be found with a fresh cup of Colombia Luminosa in Oakland, California.

It\u2019s a small town with plenty to do!Scroll down to see a map of all mentioned places.EatDuni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuni is a cafe serving a full breakfast and lunch menu, as well as homemade breads and ice cream, in a beautiful space. Get here early for your pick of their homemade breads, and definitely enjoy a meal if you have time. Everything was fresh, delicious, and thoughtfully presented. If you\u2019re feeling decadent, go for their chocolate bread french toast. The staff is lean and service can be a little slow, so it\u2019s definitely a place to sit and relax. La Miga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother cafe with delicious breads and coffees. The chocolate bread at La Miga, which is very different from Duni\u2019s version, was so good. We saw some people ordering sandwiches, but breads and coffee seem to be their main thing. When we were there, they were offering generous samples at the counter. On Google Maps this is called \u201cCrumb Bakery.\u201dSailor Will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSailor Will was on our way to our hostel, so we stopped in for lunch right after we got off the colectivo from Santa Marta. The space was beautiful, the staff was really friendly, and we could see the small kitchen from our table. We shared the menu del dia, which was a big portion of rice, meat, plantains, avocado, and beans. We didn't get pictures of the food, but obviously plenty of pictures of the Club Colombias we washed our meal down with.El Bistro de la Victoria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Bistro de la Victoria is the restaurant attached to Finca Victoria (more on that below). After a very steep hike up to the coffee farm, we were so happy to sit down at the Bistro with a couple of cold beers and sandwiches before our coffee tour. The sandwiches were huge and we probably could have shared one. Nevada Cerveceria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beers we drank at El Bistro de la Victoria are from Nevada Cerveceria, the brewery right next door to the coffee farm. You can only find their beers in a few places in this region, so I recommend trying them if you come across them. We had the pilsner and really liked it, and if you\u2019re judging a book by its cover, the labels are pretty cool. Casa Loma\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nCasa Loma, the hostel we stayed at served homemade vegetarian breakfast, lunch, and dinner at reasonable prices. We ate dinner there both nights of our stay, and some people who weren\u2019t even staying at the hostel came for the meal (it\u2019s about a 10-minute hike uphill from town, which should say something!). Each night there\u2019s one appetizer, entree, and dessert on the menu, which is posted on a chalkboard that morning so you can decide if you want to sign up. The food is individually plated and served at the shared tables where you can get to know your fellow travelers. Both our dinners were delicious with generous portions and high-quality ingredients. Lazy CatWe didn\u2019t get to try Lazy Cat, right across from Sailor Inn, but we heard from multiple people that while eating on the outdoor deck, a Toucan stopped by, ate some fries, and flew away. Sounds worth it just for that!DoSunset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunsets in Minca are beautiful. Get up to any high point and watch the sun go down and the sky change colors in between the mountains. We watched the sunset from the sunset deck at our hostel both nights. Like the dinners, many people come up to Casa Loma just for that. Pozo Azul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about a 45-minute hike up the road from town before a 15-minute walk down the path to Pozo Azul, a swimming hole. The first swimming hole was packed. We crossed this area (you have to walk through the water, so we had to take our socks and sneakers off and then put them back on) and hiked up to the second swimming hole, which was less crowded and a bit deeper. We watched teenage boys jump off the high cliff before we jumped off a slightly lower cliff :). We hiked just a little bit farther up to another swimming hole that was virtually empty, where we sat and read for a bit. There are no amenities here, save for a couple ladies grilling plantains at the entrance, so come prepared. Finca Victoria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe debated hiking up to Finca Victoria from Pozo Azul or taking a moto-taxi but ultimately walked up and took a moto-taxi back down. This hike up is very steep and challenging, but with beautiful views. We speed-walked (as much as we could uphill) and it took us 50 minutes from the start of the path to Pozo Azul. We started with lunch at the restaurant attached to the farm (see above) before our tour. There\u2019s no tour schedule, they just take you around whenever you\u2019re ready, maybe waiting to see if a couple more people show up. The tour costs $15,000 pesos and includes a cup of their coffee. La Victoria has been around since 1892 and uses water and gravity to power their automatic production of coffee beans. It\u2019s pretty impressive and we learned a lot from our knowledgeable tour guide.Chill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially if you\u2019re coming to Minca from a big city, this is a good time to relax. Life seems pretty laid-back here, and our hostel was a great place to catch up on reading, play cards, and take in the views while surrounded by nature.Moto-taxiAs mentioned, we took a moto-taxi back to our hostel from Finca Victoria. Look for the guys in black polos with blue writing; these are the official Minca moto-taxi drivers. It\u2019s a fun experience, just hold on tight!  We were only in Minca for two nights so didn\u2019t get to do everything. Here are a few other activities we read about on the blog Practical Wanderlust: Las PiedrasLas Cascadas de MarinkaFinca La CandelariaShoppingStayCasa Loma Minca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were really happy with our decision to stay at Casa Loma. As I mentioned a couple times above, people who aren\u2019t even sleeping there come up for meals and the sunset because they have so much to offer. They have a number of different types of accommodations including private rooms, open-air huts, dorms, hammocks, and tents. We chose the Casa Luna hut for its views and its private bathroom (the only one offered). This hut is secluded from the rest of the camp and has a wide open view of the mountains, plus the night sky full of stars - something you don\u2019t get in New York City! The shower has the same view, which was pretty amazing. The hut has a mosquito net over the bed and a big wooden locker, which we put all our stuff in when not using, including toiletries, for security and to keep animals away. The hut has a curtain in lieu of a door, and the noises we heard in the night took some getting used to, but waking up and going to bed with that view was worth it. Even though we stayed in the secluded hut with our own bathroom, we took advantage of the benefits of staying in a hostel, such as group dinners and meeting other travelers. We enjoyed sitting in the hammocks and at the picnic tables in the main lodge playing cards and reading. If you can manage the hike up to Casa Loma from town, I recommend booking a room here!EAT AND DO IN MINCA - MAP VIEW\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nALL COLOMBIA BLOG POSTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2019\n\n\n\nColombia, Minca, Minca activities, To Do\n\n\n\nVisiting Minca, Colombia\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2019\n\n\n\nColombia, Minca, Minca activities, To Do\n\n\nOn my recent trip to Colombia with my sister, we spent a couple nights in Minca, which is in the mountains a few hours north of Cartagena.

But Minca was by far my favourite. Its prime location among the Sierra Nevada\u2019s verdant mountaintops, the abundance of magical waterfalls and its endearing village charm stopped me in my tracks, and for a few more days than I had planned. There are so many exciting things to do in Minca, Colombia, you might end up extending your stay here too!\nJust a few years ago, this Colombian village was considered off the beaten path. Now it\u2019s on the radar. But it\u2019s still no gringolandia. It has retained its small-town allure, and the addition of a few new hipster cafes, restaurants and hostels make anyone\u2019s experience in Minca, Colombia, all the more magical. Plus, visiting Minca also means you get to say you visited the highest coastal range in the world, because the Sierra Nevada is, well, just that!\nIn this post, we\u2019ll dive into everything from what to do in Minca, how long you should stay, how to get to Minca, and where to eat in Minca. Get your travel planner out and ready!\n\nHow long should I stay in Minca?\nWhile most people only choose to spend about 2 days in Minca, there are plenty of things to do in this sleepy mountain town to keep you fully occupied for a week.\nHowever long you choose to stay here, use this list of the best things to do in Minca, Colombia, to help you plan your visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinca\u2019s main street\n\n\n\n\nHow to get to Minca, Colombia?\nIf you\u2019re wondering how to get to Minca, Colombia, you\u2019ll be glad to know it\u2019s not that difficult.\nThe cheapest way to get there is to hop on a bus from Santa Marta. Buses leave from the main square and will set you back 9\u2019000 COP per person. It\u2019s a short 1-hour journey, but you do have to wait for the bus to fill up before it leaves. The last bus also leaves at 5 pm.\nAlso bear in mind the location of where you\u2019re staying. If it\u2019s not in the village, you\u2019ll have to pay extra for a motorbike to take you there.\nThe other option is to get a taxi. This is the best option if there are a few of you or if you\u2019ve missed the last bus. The going rate is about 60\u2019000 COP, but you can easily get it for 50\u2019000 COP. It\u2019s always worth negotiating!\nYou may also enjoy: How to Haggle Abroad: 18 Useful Tips to Become a Haggling Master\n\n14 Things to do in Minca, Colombia\nVisit the Marinka Waterfalls\nWalk along a muddy track for about an hour and you\u2019ll eventually make it to the Marinka Waterfalls. If you\u2019re feeling lazy, you can just pay a motorbike to take you for about 10\u2019000 COP.\nEntry is 10\u2019000 COP at the time of this writing and gives you access to a jungle garden and two pretty big waterfalls. The first one is the biggest, and you\u2019ll feel its fine spray from a hundred metres away. This waterfall is the most majestic.\nThe second waterfall is the best one for swimming in! Just bear in mind that it can get quite busy in the plunge pool.\nThere are a lot of big hammock seats in the Marinka waterfall gardens \u2013 you\u2019ll definitely want to get a cool picture in one!\nThere\u2019s also a restaurant on site that serves up delicious food for a good price!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more majestic of the Marinka Waterfalls\n\n\n\n\nO\u00eddo del Mundo\nIf you\u2019re walking to Marinka Waterfalls, you\u2019ll pass O\u00eddo del Mundo. These are a smaller and supposedly less impressive set of waterfalls that precede Marinka, but they\u2019re much less crowded, and there\u2019s often no one there!\nVisiting O\u00eddo del Mundo is one of the best things to do in Minca, Colombia, if you really want to swim and enjoy the tranquillity of nature around you.\nI\u2019m a bit of a sucker for swimming in river water; it\u2019s always way too cold for me. The funny thing is, I didn\u2019t find the water to be that cold here. Owing to the smaller size of the waterfall, you can swim right up to it and sit right under the crashing water. Yes, it may be a bit of a throttling experience, but coming out of it makes you feel refreshed and rejuvenated!\nOf all the waterfalls in Minca, Colombia, O\u00eddo del Mundo is my favourite!Trending11 Things I Wish I knew Before Hiking Acatenango Volcano\nYou might also enjoy: Visiting Tayrona National Park in Colombia: The Ultimate Guide\n\nPlay board games at Casa Loma\nThere are a few hostels in Minca that are well-known for offering visitors incredible experiences. Casa Loma is one of those, and the best bit is, it\u2019s a short trek from the village centre.\nOnce you\u2019ve managed to hike up the mountainside to get there (15 minutes max!), you\u2019ll be rewarded with mountain and sea views reaching all the way out to Santa Marta and the Caribbean coast. You can\u2019t find a better spot to watch the sunset from this close to the village!\nThey also have a big selection of different board games in the main outdoor common area that anyone can play. The common area layout means it\u2019s also very easy to meet other travellers.\nI\u2019m also a massive fan of their vegan and vegetarian food. Everything on the menu tastes incredible, and for a bit of a gringo hostel, the prices are super economical. If you\u2019re looking for a chilled evening, a visit to Casa Loma must be on any list of things to do in Minca, Colombia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasa Loma\u2019s common area\n\n\n\n\nTry unicycling\nAbout two-thirds of the way up to Casa Loma, you\u2019ll pass a circus master\u2019s house. He offers aerial acrobatics, slackline and unicycle classes that you can try out for a fraction of the price as in other countries.\nIf you\u2019re wondering what to do in Minca, Colombia, that isn\u2019t hiking or waterfalls, this might be for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nGo on a coffee and cacao tour\nThe mountains around Santa Marta are some of the best in the country when it comes to producing coffee and cacao. A trip to Minca is therefore a perfect excuse to learn more about the harvesting and production process of both of these brown beans.\nThere are a few places you can do a tour. Finca La Candelaria and Finca San Rafael both do coffee and cacao tours. You can combine them or just do one. If you just want a coffee tour, you can also visit La Victoria.\nFor my cacao tour, I visited Finca San Rafael. I could not have been more impressed. Included in the tour, I was given a cacao face mask to smoother all over my face, paired with the most delicious cup of cold hot chocolate I\u2019ve ever had. There are only two places I\u2019ve ever tried hot chocolate and liked it; Finca San Rafael and Oaxaca, Mexico.\u00a0\nGoing on a coffee or cacao tour is one of the best things to do in Minca, Colombia. But whatever finca you decide to go to, they\u2019re all very out of the way. You either have to walk for a few hours to get there or pay for a motorbike to take you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLounge in a giant hammock at Sierra Minca\nRemember I mentioned earlier about some of the best hostels in Minca? Well, this is another one of them. Maybe even the best. There are a few places in and around Minca that allow you to sit in their suspended hammocks, but none are quite as big as the ones they have at Sierra Minca.\nFor a small entrance fee, you can enjoy the phenomenal mountain and sea views from their gigantic hammocks and spend a whole morning here. The only downside is that Sierra Minca is quite a long motorbike ride out of Minca. That\u2019s code for expensive. But if you\u2019re wondering what to do in Minca to chill, this might just be it.\n\nDrink cocktails at the Lazy Cat\nWondering what to do in Minca, Colombia, at night? Go and grab a cocktail!\nYou\u2019ll find The Lazy Cat on Minca\u2019s main street. It\u2019s the ideal spot to end your day of adventuring by splashing out on a few ridiculously cheap cocktails. Colombians are so friendly that you\u2019ll also more than likely end your night here with a couple of new friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking friends with a new four-legged pal\n\n\n\n\nVisit Pozo Azul waterfall\nThe truth is, the area around Minca is blessed with an abundance of waterfalls.\nPozo Azul is a 2-hour walk from the centre of Minca and you can either walk it, or pay for a motorbike to take you.\nHere you can go for a swim in the VERY cold river water and enjoy the waterfall from afar. There\u2019s a risk of getting pulled under the closer you get to the falls, so unfortunately you can\u2019t swim past the rope barrier. Regardless of that, it\u2019s a fun place to cool off, splash about and spend a few hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPozo Azul Waterfall\n\n\n\n\nHike to a viewpoint\nWhen you ask most people about going on hikes in Minca, they\u2019ll surely tell you about the Los Pinos viewpoint hike. It\u2019s one of the lengthier hikes in Minca, taking about 4 hours to get there from the village.\nBut the views are more than worth it! If you\u2019re very lucky, you may run into a motorbike on the way down that\u2019ll take you back for a fee. If not, it\u2019s another 3 hours walk down to the village.\nBut now for the best hike in Minca; the 360\u00ba viewpoint hike. Not only is this one much more unheard of, but it\u2019s also a lot closer. It only takes 2 hours to get there (although it is steep!), and you\u2019ll probably have the place to yourself! If you\u2019re looking for hikes in Minca, don\u2019t skip this one!\nAs the name suggests, the views from up here are unparalleled. Who says no to a 360\u00ba view of mountains, sea and luscious forest?! Hike up in the afternoon so you can watch the sunset for an extra special experience. For those wondering what to do in Minca, Colombia, with an abundance of energy, this is for you!\nUse this guide to help you get there.\n\nStop for ice cream in Waira\nOn the way back from your Marinka waterfall hike, you\u2019ll pass by Waira, a chic ice cream and coffee shop.\u00a0I had the best ice cream I\u2019ve had in all of Colombia here!\nThey have some very funky ice cream flavours, from intense chocolate made with organic cacao to dragon blood and even lavender sorbet! The cakes they have up on display will also make your mouth drool. It\u2019s best to come here on an empty stomach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur huge portions of cacao and dragon\u2019s blood ice cream\n\n\n\n\nGo to the cinema\nYep, you read that right. Minca has its very own cinema. Ask in La Miga bakery for more information on what movies are being shown and the times.\nThe only downside is they normally only show them in Spanish, so it\u2019s not ideal for everyone.\n\nGo birdwatching\nColombia is the most biodiverse country in the world per square kilometre. Knowing that, it\u2019s unsurprising that it\u2019s also the second most biodiverse country in the world when it comes to birds.\nMinca is one of the best places to go birdwatching in the country. Even if you\u2019re not the biggest bird enthusiast (I\u2019m not!), going on a bird-watching tour with Jungle Joe will bring the bird passionista out of you!\nIf you can muster the courage to wake up in time for the 6 am start, Joe will fill you in with all sorts of incredible bird and wildlife facts and point out some very cool and funky birds you otherwise never would have noticed. I\u2019m talking hummingbirds, toucans and macaws!\nDespite having to roll out of my bed at 5 am, this was one of my favourite activities in Minca, Colombia. And for only 50\u2019000 COP per person, it\u2019s a steal!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJungle Joe\u2019s bird watching tour\n\n\n\n\nGo on a motorcycle ride\nThere are a lot of hikes in Minca, which equates to a lot of walking. You might like to treat yourself to a motorbike ride and then walk back from somewhere to make things easier.\nPlus, motorbike rides in and of themselves are one of the most fun things to do in Minca, Colombia! The tracks in the area are often bumpy and sea-saw-like in terms of their ascents and descents, so whizzing around the muddy mountain paths on a motorbike can be quite a thrilling experience!\nJust beware that it\u2019s not common for you to be given a helmet unless you ask for a rider that\u2019s willing to lend you theirs.\nYou might also enjoy: A Backpacker\u2019s Guide to Palomino, Colombia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreat yourself to a chocolate massage\nOkay, this is definitely not one of the most budget-friendly things to do in Minca, but your tired backpack-carrying back will thank you for it later.\nCasa Loma offers a selection of different massages in their very peaceful open-air jungle massage room. If I recall correctly, they offered energy, wood, hot stone, and chocolate massages, all for about 120\u2019000 COP.\nSince Minca is a big cacao-producing region, I opted for the one-hour chocolate massage for 120\u2019000 COP. It\u2019s the only massage I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019m coming back for more!\nIf you\u2019re wondering what to do in Minca, Colombia, to really really relax and unwind, this is it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasa Loma\u2019s relaxing jungle massage room\n\n\n\n\nWhere to eat in Minca\nOver the last few years, Minca has grown to have quite a number of restaurants, cafes and bakeries popping up all over the village centre. A lot of them are also vegan and vegetarian-friendly.\nAlthough you might not be able to try them all, I visited 80% of them for you. Here are my favourites\u2026\nCasa Aney \nThis is without a doubt my favourite place to eat in Minca. The place is run by an Israeli and serves up really yummy pizza and lots of different Middle Eastern dips like hummus, babbaganoush and tzatziki. They also sell homemade kombucha (ask for a behind-the-scenes tour of where it\u2019s made!) and a mouth-wateringly delicious seaweed salad.\nIn the evening, lots of candles come out turning it into the most romantic date spot in the village!\nMake sure you visit Casa Aney as one of your things to do in Minca, Colombia. I visited on my last night so I only had the chance to GO there once. I was so gutted that I couldn\u2019t visit again.\nIf you\u2019re wondering what to do in Minca, Colombia, at night, go and eat in Casa Aney!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the best food I had in Colombia\n\n\n\n\nDuni\nAt the foot of the hike to Casa Loma (just off the village\u2019s park), you\u2019ll see Duni tucked away in a corner. This is another vegan-friendly place that serves up scrumptious breakfasts and has some really yummy baked treats. I recommend the brownie and the cheese and spinach rolls.\n\nCasa Loma\nI mentioned this place before, but it deserves mentioning again. Casa Loma\u2019s restaurant serves up a whole array of different foods from burgers, to lasagna, salad bowls and delicious desserts. The best bit is, it\u2019s all plant-based, and every single dish is a treat to your taste buds (and your wallet!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA wholesome start to the day at Casa Loma\n\n\n\n\nMarhaba\nThis is another place serving up middle eastern flavours and falafel plates. You can also indulge in one of their tasty pizzas on one of their wooden stools overlooking the street. This is a great little spot, but if you want hummus, Casa Aney does it better.\nIf you were wondering where to eat in Minca, hopefully, this list has helped a bit!\n\nWhere to stay in Minca\nCASA LOMA \u2013 If you\u2019re looking for a hostel that\u2019s not too far from the village but still has an in-the-middle-of-nowhere feel to it, Casa Loma is your best bet. Just a 15-minute hike up from Minca village, it boasts panoramic views over a thriving green mountain landscape and as far out as the city of Santa Marta. The wooden hilltop house also has lots of common areas with swing chairs and board games, plus they have live music on the weekends and daily yoga classes. This is definitely one of my go-to hostels in Minca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset views from Casa Loma\n\n\n\n\nSIERRA MINCA \u2013 Hostel views don\u2019t get much better than the ones at Sierra Minca. It\u2019s home to the largest hammocks in the world and a pool with unrivalled views over the mountains. But for all of these benefits, you do have to sacrifice your proximity to Minca village. Because of this, you\u2019re very reliant on the services they provide. Motorbike taxis take about 30 minutes to get to the hostel, which will set you back at least 20\u2019000 COP for each journey. Visiting Sierra Minca is one of the top things to do in Minca, Colombia, though. So if you don\u2019t stay here, you can still visit for a day!\nFINCA CARPE DIEM \u2013 If you\u2019re interested in staying in an eco-lodge while in Minca, this is my top pick. While it\u2019s not actually in Minca (it\u2019s in the nearby village area of Paso del Mango), this is a very recommendable place to stay if you want to be surrounded by rivers, mountains and forests. Come here for wild, untamed nature and a few days of being disconnected (or more connected you could say).\nLA GUACAMAYA \u2013 While I wouldn\u2019t say this is one of the best hostels in Minca, it\u2019s definitely one of the cheapest. The dorm room is super basic, but you only pay 20\u2019000 COP per night, and it\u2019s right in the centre of Minca village. They also have a pet macaw here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHostel La Guacamaya\u2019s friendly macaw\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do in Minca, Colombia: a summary\nAnddddd\u2026that\u2019s a wrap. Hopefully, this guide on what to do in Minca, Colombia, will help you plan your trip to this wonderful mountain village. With so many fun things to do in Minca, Colombia, you might end up extending your stay here just like me.\n\u00a0\n\nPin this article for later!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPopular Posts11 Things I Wish I knew Before Hiking Acatenango VolcanoCartagena, Colombia: Is it Really Worth Visiting?19 Fun Free Things to Do in Barcelona\n\nFollowFollowFollow\n\nPlease assume that every link on theglobetrottingturtle.com is an affiliate link (Yay for transparency!).

It\u2019s a small town with plenty to do!Scroll down to see a map of all mentioned places.EatDuni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuni is a cafe serving a full breakfast and lunch menu, as well as homemade breads and ice cream, in a beautiful space. Get here early for your pick of their homemade breads, and definitely enjoy a meal if you have time. Everything was fresh, delicious, and thoughtfully presented. If you\u2019re feeling decadent, go for their chocolate bread french toast. The staff is lean and service can be a little slow, so it\u2019s definitely a place to sit and relax. La Miga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother cafe with delicious breads and coffees. The chocolate bread at La Miga, which is very different from Duni\u2019s version, was so good. We saw some people ordering sandwiches, but breads and coffee seem to be their main thing. When we were there, they were offering generous samples at the counter. On Google Maps this is called \u201cCrumb Bakery.\u201dSailor Will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSailor Will was on our way to our hostel, so we stopped in for lunch right after we got off the colectivo from Santa Marta. The space was beautiful, the staff was really friendly, and we could see the small kitchen from our table. We shared the menu del dia, which was a big portion of rice, meat, plantains, avocado, and beans. We didn't get pictures of the food, but obviously plenty of pictures of the Club Colombias we washed our meal down with.El Bistro de la Victoria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Bistro de la Victoria is the restaurant attached to Finca Victoria (more on that below). After a very steep hike up to the coffee farm, we were so happy to sit down at the Bistro with a couple of cold beers and sandwiches before our coffee tour. The sandwiches were huge and we probably could have shared one. Nevada Cerveceria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beers we drank at El Bistro de la Victoria are from Nevada Cerveceria, the brewery right next door to the coffee farm. You can only find their beers in a few places in this region, so I recommend trying them if you come across them. We had the pilsner and really liked it, and if you\u2019re judging a book by its cover, the labels are pretty cool. Casa Loma\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nCasa Loma, the hostel we stayed at served homemade vegetarian breakfast, lunch, and dinner at reasonable prices. We ate dinner there both nights of our stay, and some people who weren\u2019t even staying at the hostel came for the meal (it\u2019s about a 10-minute hike uphill from town, which should say something!). Each night there\u2019s one appetizer, entree, and dessert on the menu, which is posted on a chalkboard that morning so you can decide if you want to sign up. The food is individually plated and served at the shared tables where you can get to know your fellow travelers. Both our dinners were delicious with generous portions and high-quality ingredients. Lazy CatWe didn\u2019t get to try Lazy Cat, right across from Sailor Inn, but we heard from multiple people that while eating on the outdoor deck, a Toucan stopped by, ate some fries, and flew away. Sounds worth it just for that!DoSunset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunsets in Minca are beautiful. Get up to any high point and watch the sun go down and the sky change colors in between the mountains. We watched the sunset from the sunset deck at our hostel both nights. Like the dinners, many people come up to Casa Loma just for that. Pozo Azul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about a 45-minute hike up the road from town before a 15-minute walk down the path to Pozo Azul, a swimming hole. The first swimming hole was packed. We crossed this area (you have to walk through the water, so we had to take our socks and sneakers off and then put them back on) and hiked up to the second swimming hole, which was less crowded and a bit deeper. We watched teenage boys jump off the high cliff before we jumped off a slightly lower cliff :). We hiked just a little bit farther up to another swimming hole that was virtually empty, where we sat and read for a bit. There are no amenities here, save for a couple ladies grilling plantains at the entrance, so come prepared. Finca Victoria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe debated hiking up to Finca Victoria from Pozo Azul or taking a moto-taxi but ultimately walked up and took a moto-taxi back down. This hike up is very steep and challenging, but with beautiful views. We speed-walked (as much as we could uphill) and it took us 50 minutes from the start of the path to Pozo Azul. We started with lunch at the restaurant attached to the farm (see above) before our tour. There\u2019s no tour schedule, they just take you around whenever you\u2019re ready, maybe waiting to see if a couple more people show up. The tour costs $15,000 pesos and includes a cup of their coffee. La Victoria has been around since 1892 and uses water and gravity to power their automatic production of coffee beans. It\u2019s pretty impressive and we learned a lot from our knowledgeable tour guide.Chill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially if you\u2019re coming to Minca from a big city, this is a good time to relax. Life seems pretty laid-back here, and our hostel was a great place to catch up on reading, play cards, and take in the views while surrounded by nature.Moto-taxiAs mentioned, we took a moto-taxi back to our hostel from Finca Victoria. Look for the guys in black polos with blue writing; these are the official Minca moto-taxi drivers. It\u2019s a fun experience, just hold on tight!  We were only in Minca for two nights so didn\u2019t get to do everything. Here are a few other activities we read about on the blog Practical Wanderlust: Las PiedrasLas Cascadas de MarinkaFinca La CandelariaShoppingStayCasa Loma Minca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were really happy with our decision to stay at Casa Loma. As I mentioned a couple times above, people who aren\u2019t even sleeping there come up for meals and the sunset because they have so much to offer. They have a number of different types of accommodations including private rooms, open-air huts, dorms, hammocks, and tents. We chose the Casa Luna hut for its views and its private bathroom (the only one offered). This hut is secluded from the rest of the camp and has a wide open view of the mountains, plus the night sky full of stars - something you don\u2019t get in New York City! The shower has the same view, which was pretty amazing. The hut has a mosquito net over the bed and a big wooden locker, which we put all our stuff in when not using, including toiletries, for security and to keep animals away. The hut has a curtain in lieu of a door, and the noises we heard in the night took some getting used to, but waking up and going to bed with that view was worth it. Even though we stayed in the secluded hut with our own bathroom, we took advantage of the benefits of staying in a hostel, such as group dinners and meeting other travelers. We enjoyed sitting in the hammocks and at the picnic tables in the main lodge playing cards and reading. If you can manage the hike up to Casa Loma from town, I recommend booking a room here!EAT AND DO IN MINCA - MAP VIEW\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nALL COLOMBIA BLOG POSTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2019\n\n\n\nColombia, Minca, Minca activities, To Do\n\n\n\nVisiting Minca, Colombia\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2019\n\n\n\nColombia, Minca, Minca activities, To Do\n\n\nOn my recent trip to Colombia with my sister, we spent a couple nights in Minca, which is in the mountains a few hours north of Cartagena.

Plus, the coffee is richly flavored and delicious.\n\nIf you ever make it to Minca, you MUST try this bread, especially early in the morning fresh from the oven. Amazing.Josephine Johnson \u2014 Google reviewCharming little bakery. They make 3 breads - ciabatta, banquets, and chocolate bun. They offer bread samples for tasting if you\u2019re not sure which to get. They also have a proper espresso/coffee machine. Latte and coffee after a day\u2019s activities? Yes, please. My cafe latte and chocolate bread was 8K COP altogether. Google maps show this place as \u201cCrumb Bakery,\u201d which is a bit confusing because their store sign shows \u201cLa Miga.\u201d Luckily people posted pictures. Plus, you can\u2019t miss the commercial size ovens in the back.Lucy \u2014 Google reviewWe tried the donut con dulce de leche and the bread with chocolate chips. While the latter was really tasty, the former one was slightly dry. However, we appreciated the low sugar content in both of them.Ophelie Chuffart \u2014 Google reviewYou must go here if you visit Minca, and I guarantee you will go back once you do! These gals make a mean loaf of bread. My girlfriend and I were extremely pleased to find REAL bread, while staying in Minca for a couple days. It\u2019s truly hard to find quality bread in most of Latin America. They also sell hummus from a shop across the street that pairs very well with the bread products. Highly recommended!Brian Driscoll \u2014 Google reviewBreads, freshly made you can taste it. Better coffe so far than I've had in the 3 days I've here.

They also sell coffee beans. The place is a super traditional coffee factory.Gabe Kagan \u2014 Google reviewWe arrived with high expectations after reading the reviews. Upon arrival a lady asked in what language we would like to do the tour and told us where to go. There was a group that had already started the tour and so we missed its beginning. That was a bit irritating for us. It wouldnt have been a problem for us to wait a bit for a new group to gather. During our tour we saw 2 further groups start the tour\u2026. We felt disappointed for being told to join the group that had already started and not getting the whole tour experience.\nIdk, if they have changed something, but we only recieved one cup of coffee.Margarita K \u2014 Google reviewVery nice coffee factory with machines still in use which are over a 100 years old. We took an (English) tour and learned the coffee bean process from a to z. And we even got to taste the coffee which was included in the tour. All in all a great experience!\nPs. The road from the main road to the factory is a dirt road with lots of boog holes and trenches. Definitely recommend to either walk, take a motor (taxi) or some kind of 4*4. Not a normal car.Bva Dk \u2014 Google reviewWow, what an experience!  We hiked all the way from Minca up to Finca Victoria (careful, it's a lonnnnng uphill hike) and I was totally pleasantly surprised with this coffee farm.\n\nThe people are super nice, the place is mega sustainable (everything is run off one generator that's powered by a stream), and the coffee is truly perfect.  I'm not a fan of drip coffee, I like espresso, but this was hand's down some of the best coffee I've ever had (which makes sense, they sell the unroasted beans for an egregious amount).\n\nDid the tour and it was highly informative, learned a lot, got to see the different qualities of beans, how they gravity separate, etc etc.  At the end you get a cup of coffee.\n\nThere's also a small restaurant with beer and snacks, and the area is stunningly beautiful, and we even managed to see some monkeys in the distance.  Much of the walk up to the farm is through coffee trees.\n\nJust keep in mind if you walk that there are dirt bikes and trucks sometimes, and it can be quite dusty if it hasn't rained.  If I were to do it again, I would rent a mountain bike.Max Stanton \u2014 Google reviewEveryone said it was a must do when visiting Minca, but it was kind of underwhelming. For 25000/person plus 15000 motor taxi each way I wouldn't say it's a must do at all. The tour was meh.. included two small cups of coffee, which was good, but wouldn't have it on my list of recommendations for someone visiting the area.Zach \u2014 Google reviewSanta Marta, Magdalena, Colombia4Tienda Cafe MincaSaveSlide 1 of 54.2(55)\u20224.5(99)CafeSlide 1 of 3We had good veggie food here, the Italian panino and veggie burger with homemade fries were tasty.\nIt\u2019s a nice caf\u00e9 and it\u2019s reasonably priced.

We headed there for the 5pm-7pm happy hour with $10000  burgers and $5000 cups of wine.\n\nThat burger was sitting between a couple of clouds of deliciousness.

One of the best food we had on our travel. They deserve more crowd. We highly recommend this place. And this comes from two chefs from London. Well done \ud83d\ude0aElena Smileva \u2014 Google reviewWorst meal of our lives. Horrible service and attitude...wait staff rolling eyes. Asked specifically for patacones and they gave us fried sweet banana, ordered a bacon burger and came with no bacon, asked for no milk or cheese with my mushrooms and they served me raw undercooked mushrooms submerged in cheesy watery soup, the chicken seemed as if they microwaved it. Overcharged for the tiny portion. Addressed the issue and there was no apologies. Got diarrea after. Not sure if the people staffing at the moment were the owners but whoever was there were non-shalant and careless, did not welcome us and despite the basic request from the menu they decided to make whatever they felt like rather than acknowledging what was on the description of our order. Would not recommend this place for anyone.Hanna Casta?eda \u2014 Google reviewWe wanted food to go and the chef came out to talk to us about all the options.

Check out my list of 10+ fun things to do whilst you're there. And yep... There's hiking involved!Famous for its chocolate and coffee farms, the sparsely populated town of Minca lays nestled in the hills and mountains of Colombia's Sierra Nevada. Recently growing in popularity with backpackers and travellers, it's the perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of Santa Marta and indulge into the luscious green hills surrounding the town.With an array of hiking trails at your feet, hiking in Minca will take you to some incredible viewpoints. Get out those trekking toes because you're about to experience some incredible landscapes in Colombia. It would be great to take you with me on an adventure around Minca, but for now, I'll have to resort to listing out amazing things to do in Minca on your next visit to Colombia! Everything you need to visit Minca, Colombia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGorgeous sunsets in MincaDive into Cascada de MarinkaAround a 2 hour walk from the main town of Minca, head to the Cascada de Marinka for a refreshing dip into the waterfalls. With natural pools of fresh water, it's perfect for swimming or lying in one of the many hammocks at the foot of the hill. There's an entrance fee of $5,000 COP and a restaurant by the waterfall.Handy tip: Download maps.meon your phone before your hikes in Minca. It's pretty easy to take the wrong route and then have to backtrack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCascada de MarinkaIndulge in coffee and chocolate farmsA trip to Colombia wouldn't be complete without a visit to a local Finca. There are many coffee farms scattered around Minca offering daily tours and a chance to buy locally produced coffee directly from producers.La Candelaria also includes daily chocolate tours where they take you through the production of cacao into chocolate. I loved this tour so much, I'm thinking of writing a blog post on it at a later date! As it involved chocolate, this was easily one of my favourite tours! My recommendation? Come in the afternoon with a friend and ask the tour guide to taste the cacao bean when it's sweet. It's strange having something sweet for it to then taste really bitter at the end of the process. You'll even get to finish the tour with a chocolate face mask!The price of a chocolate or coffee tour is $25,000 COP. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa Candalaria\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting down and dirty...La Victoria, a coffee plantation farm what also produces beer also has daily tours starting at around $15,000 COP. It's around a 2-hour walk from the main town or 20 minutes on a motorbike.Hike to a 365 degree panoramic viewIf you do anything in Minca, do this!! My advice? Head there for sunset and bring a torch!To get to the panoramic views, head to hostel Mundo Nuevo. From Mundo Nuevo hike up the hill around 10 minutes more until you get to a sign that points to Mirador 360. Keep heading up the hill and there's a clear sign at the end for Finca Alesia. Turn left. You'll see some houses on the right and a sign on a tree that points you towards Mirador 360.You'll be walking along a narrow path for around 10-15 minutes. Lookout for a small sign on the left pointing you in the direction of a very narrow trail.Follow the trail to the top for stunning views and a breathtaking sunset.If you're unsure, ask the staff inside Mundo Nuevo. The cats are really friendly! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMirador 360 - honestly my photos don't do it justice!Take a moment at Los PinosLos Pinos is a beautiful viewpoint over the valley and Santa Marta. It's best to go on a clear day as the clouds can obscure the visibility.From Minca it's around 3-4 hours walking and on a hot day it can be pretty exhausting. A good idea is to take a motorbike there and hike back.Chill out in a hammock and do nothingYep. This is totally a thing. Especially in Minca where they're reputed to have more hammocks than people.Casa Elementor is a favourite but there are better ones IMO, especially ones where you don't need to pay for a view of the mountains. Hostels Mundo Nuevo, Casa Viejas and Loma Nueva all have stunning views. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHammock Minca | Sunset | Colombia\n\n\n\n\n\nMy favourite hammock! Underneath a mandarin tree overlooking the mountains in MincaBird watchingThere are over 300 species of birds in the Sierra Nevada, the highest diversity of birds on the planet, in Minca you have the opportunity to see 162 species. It's an early morning tour with Jungle Joe and one of the highest rated activities to do.Hike up to Loma NuevaIn fact, the hike up to Loma Nueva is totally worth it. It's cooler and fresher and you can even have a drink on their terrace as you soak up the wonderful mountain air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHammock Loma Nueva Hostal\n\n\n\n\n\nMore hammocks!Dine at Casa Loma for dinnerThe hostel Casa Loma nestled in the hills has beautiful views and a delicious vegetarian meal every evening at around 8 - 8:30 pm. All ingredients are fresh and due to limited space, you'll need to get there early to register unless you're already staying in the hostel.Hike in a loop around MincaLimited for time? If you're feeling adventurous, the entire loop around Minca can be done in 9-10 hours. Either clockwise or counter-clockwise you'll head past Cascada de Marinka, the waterfall Pozo Azul and Los Pinos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinca Colombia\n\n\n\n\n\nStunning luscious green mountains!Watch the sunset from Mundo NuevoMy recommendation would be to stay at Mundo Nuevo. Fullstop.When I popped by for directions to mirador 360, the serene calm atmosphere and beautiful views prompted me to stay in Minca for 3 more nights!Every evenings, everyone gathers at the bottom of the ledge to watch the sun go down on Minca as the sky lights up in dusty hues of pink and amber.It's definitely one of my top five places I've stayed in South America!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMundo NuevoHead to Donde Raul for Friday night SalsaLooking for a place to let loose for an evening? Donde Rahl is a popular place where locals and tourists gather to salsa and dance the night.If you're like me and can't dance, don't worry! There's always someone around to help you out and even teach you a step or two!Where to eat in MincaFor one reason or another, most recommendations included going to the Lazy Cat, apparently one of the best places in town.Whilst I ate there a couple of times and it was all lovely, I didn't find it to be anything special. But maybe that's just me.Casa de Loma is high up there on my recommendations and Duni is absolutely amazing.If you're looking for something simple, the French bakery, La Miga, in town that does some delicious home made baguettes with various dips of hummus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinca Sunsets\n\n\n\n\n\nYep! Another gorgeous sunset!How to get to MincaOutside Mercado Publico in Santa Marta, there are regular buses/jeeps that leave for Minca for $8000 COP. Stock up on insect repellentDuring the dry season the mosquito situation wasn't too bad. However, if you are planning on hiking in the mountains, definitely bring insect repellent.The best kind is locally sourced. Casa de Graciela located on the main road, with a sign for selling honey outside, two houses down from the butchers sells the best insect repellent around for $7000 COP. And it's natural! It did the trick and I barely got bitten!Just ask a few locals, they'll point you in the right direction if you tell them you're looking to buy 'repellente' at 'Casa de Graciela'. You can even show them this picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Insect Repellent\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's natural!How to get aroundMost people hike to get to places. However, it can get really hot and there are motor taxis you can take to pretty much anywhere. The drivers are next to the 'bus stop' in town. Prices are fixed and vary depending on where you go.Where to stayHostel Coco Bomgo is located in the centre of town which is really convenient if you're looking to enjoy the restaurants and local hang outs. Incredibly clean and friendly, they were a great place to spend my first few nights. Check here for availability.My biggest recommendation is to spend a couple of nights in the mountains, enjoying delicious food, sunsets and beautiful views. Mundo Nuevo was so amazing that I ended up extending my stay in Minca. Their outdoor bathrooms are pretty cool and the hammock underneath the mandarin tree is the perfect place to chill as you watch the sunset over the mountains. With great wifi, check out the latest prices here.Casas Viejas, also located in the mountains is also another perfect chill out hostel and gets booked out pretty quickly. Check it outhere.It's also worth pointing out that unless you have a light enough backpack, you'll be taking a motorbike taxi to the hostels located in the mountains. It's around $20,000-25,000 COP.Planning a trip or fancy a freebie?

It smells of caramel, bark, charcoal, and chocolate. The source? Coffee beans, fresh from backyard roasters, their sharp burnt odor cutting through the humid tropical haze.Here in northern Colombia, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta range rises straight from the shores of the Caribbean. Long left undeveloped due to political troubles, this now peaceful area draws urban Colombians and savvy international visitors to the palm-fringed beaches of Tayrona National Park, the ancient archaeological site of Ciudad Perdida, and the birding paradise of the jungles around Minca.Recently, Minca and the Sierra Nevada have begun to attract coffee-loving travelers, a collection of connoisseurs and curious backpackers eager to discover what Juan Pablo Campos, general manager of the Lohas Beans trade group, calls \u201cthe most important Colombian region for organic coffee.\u201dUsing a pestle, Minca coffee grower Angel Maria Orozco peels the hard outer skin of dried coffee beans.Photograph by Francesco LastrucciPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.While coffee is not native to Colombia, the plant has flourished for centuries on the country\u2019s steep, shade-covered mountains, with rainfall, altitude, and temperatures ideal for growing the mellow, medium-bodied arabica-style bean. Colombia has been exporting coffee since the early 1800s, and in 2015 alone shipped 840,000 tons of coffee beans. Represented by the fictional ambassadors Juan Valdez and his trusty burro, Conchita, \u201cCaf\u00e9 de Colombia\u201d has become known worldwide.A map of northern Colombia, where the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta range rises straight from the shores of the Caribbean\nNG Maps, World Database on Protected AreasPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.Colombia\u2019s better-known \u201ccoffee triangle\u201d in the country\u2019s southwest now supports a well-trod tourist track between luxury lodges and standardized plantation tours, but the Sierra Nevada still offers an authentic journey into the past\u2014and a taste of the future of Colombian coffee. In remote highlands, indigenous tribes of Kogi and Arhuaco lead the way in organic coffee production, developing a sustainable farming network that combines traditional spiritual beliefs with modern planting knowledge. These farms embrace generations-old techniques and tools to produce sought-after organic blends, with many beans \u201ctriple certified\u201d as organic, fair trade, and rain forest-friendly.A local harvest of organically grown coffee fruit eventually ends up as a drink to linger over at Ikaro Caf\u00e9, in Santa Marta.Photograph by Francesco LastrucciPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.The gateway to the region is the sunny Caribbean seaside city of Santa Marta, where the bitter street blend of tinto (from the Spanish word for ink) black coffee is sweetened with spoonfuls of sugar. Coffee aficionados will skip the tinto, as well as the ubiquitous Juan Valdez chain stores, and head to Santa Marta\u2019s smaller shops, such as Ikaro Caf\u00e9.Exploring the area\u2019s coffee culture is best done during harvest season, from about November through February, and can be as simple as hiring a taxi for the approximately 40-minute, 15-mile bumpy ride from the sea to the hills. Visits to tribal lands require special permission or an organized trip from an approved local operator such as Wiwa Tour.A stop at Hacienda la Victoria above Minca is like traveling to 1892, when the farm was founded. Husband-and-wife owners Micky and Claudia Weber provide a bean-to-brew education on growing, processing, and roasting coffee. Visitors will see the same well-oiled machinery in use since the farm\u2019s beginnings: water-powered generators, gravity-driven sorters, and hand-cranked presses. Tours conclude with a tasting of their blends, often accompanied by homemade apple pie. Other local farms promote scheduled and drop-in tours and tastings of high-end coffees\u2014a difference from only a few years ago when Colombia had an unofficial policy of \u201cexport the best, and drink the rest.\u201dAt Hacienda la Victoria, owner Claudia Weber inhales the robust aroma of freshly washed and dried coffee beans.Photograph by Francesco LastrucciPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.Drinking a good cup of coffee is just the beginning of a trip to Minca, where swaths of coffee beans dry on streetside tarps in season. Hiking trails wind through Sierra Nevada rain forest to the Marinka and Pozo Azul waterfalls. Hundreds of butterfly and bird species native to the area include \u201cparrots so plentiful they\u2019re like pigeons,\u201d according to one visitor.A local harvest of organically grown coffee fruit in northern Colombia\nPhotograph by Francesco LastrucciPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.Minca plantations may flash back a few generations, but indigenous Kogi farms (or those of the more remote Arhuaco), located deeper in the mountains, are a journey back centuries. The tribes live without electricity in traditional adobe huts with thatched roofs. They often carry their mochila (handwoven knapsack) and wear homespun cotton clothing, white to symbolize the purity of nature. Their traditional conical headgear represents sacred snowcapped mountain peaks. Their mamos (spiritual guides) perform purification ceremonies of prayer and song prior to planting and harvesting the beans.It all works in harmony with the land, their neighbors, and modern markets, nurturing a future model not only for growing coffee but for ripening Colombian tourism itself.Where to Get a Cup of JoeIkaro Caf\u00e9 Local organic coffee, vegan and vegetarian fare, and a bright interior make this one of the best hangouts in Santa Marta.Tienda Caf\u00e9 Fans of this classic Minca spot savor their cups of local roasts (and a brownie) outside on the porch, but head inside for a trove of handicrafts for sale.Hacienda la Victoria Enjoy un caf\u00e9 \u2028at its source at \u2028this 124-year-old family-owned coffee plantation, which also offers tours and an on-site bistro.Nat Geo ExpeditionsBook your next trip with Peace of MindSearch TripsWhere to StayEcohabs Tayrona Thatched seaside bungalows designed by a local architect nestle in Tayrona National Park.La Brisa Loca At this social Santa Marta hostel, friendships form at the courtyard pool and the rooftop bar.Casa Loma Minca The view from the top is worth the climb up the long flight of stairs to this Minca hostel on a hill.Travel to Colombia with Nat Geo A 12-day itinerary includes the country\u2019s southeastern coffee triangle and Tayrona National Park.BILL FINK (@finktravels) can often be found with a fresh cup of Colombia Luminosa in Oakland, California.
